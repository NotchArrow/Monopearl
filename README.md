Monopearl is a simple Minecraft mod for PvP servers that limits each player to one active ender pearl at a time. This prevents pearl-chaining or pearl spamming in fights and it forces players to weigh the costs of a stasis chamber. Stasis chambers can still be used, but they fill the player's pearl cap and prevent them from using ender pearls elsewhere in the world.
